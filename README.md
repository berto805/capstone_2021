# Introduction
Is a software tool that helps manage logs. Its a great way to centralize logs. Many companies under utilize their existing administration tools because they use too many. Graylog provides ways to simplify all that extra work of maintaining so many tools. 

Graylog allows organizations to have a centralized log location for all the logs being generated inside individual servers. Inside a server you can have different types of logs such as apache, php, mysql, application, etc. With the proper configuration on the server we are able collect very useful logs tailored for each organization's requirements. This can minimize who has access to the servers and instead provide developers or users a better way to look at logs. For example, users accessing the server see raw data that is generally difficult and time consuming to parse manually. By using Graylog, you can see live data and also run custom queries for better searches in order to quickly identify any issues or security incidents.
